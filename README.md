# Schedulr++

**Schedulr++** is a visual CPU scheduling simulator built using **C++** (compiled to WebAssembly) and a modern **React + Tailwind CSS** frontend.

It supports visualizing:

- FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
- SJF (Preemptive & Non-preemptive)
- Round Robin
- Priority (Preemptive & Non-preemptive)

🎯 Designed to help students and developers understand how scheduling algorithms work in real-time using interactive Gantt charts and animations.
